If you are currently working somewhere, you are well aware of the fact that a job is a very nice thing to have. I work a job at subway, and in addition to that, I also have an internship for the city  government as a data entrist. I still have time to do things I enjoy, but as we age we realize that we can't do the things we enjoy as frequent as we could such as when we were part timers. I work noon to 4 on Wednesday-Sunday at subway on average, as a busboy and dishwasher, and then I work the morning shift at the city hall as a data entrist intern. I have a jam packed schedule and only have a few hours at night to do things I want before having to turn in at 8 to repeat the process. The nice thing is I have weekends off of the internship, and I have Mondays and Tuesdays off of subway. However you can't deny that people like me have a lot to do, and that is why things that are hobbies are less frequent. I will still try to make a video about the new 1080p monitor I get at some point, so until then, tata.
